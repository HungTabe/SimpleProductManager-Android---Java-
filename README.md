# Simple Product Manager (Android - Java)

This is a practice exercise to build a simple **Product Management App** using **Java** and **SQLite** on Android.  
The app displays a product list with `RecyclerView`, allows users to view product details, and manages data with a local database.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how **Activity** and **XML layouts** work together (`inflate` mechanism).  
- Practice **binding UI elements** (`findViewById`) to manipulate views in Activities.  
- Implement **RecyclerView** with a custom `Adapter` to display product lists.  
- Set up **SQLite database** using `SQLiteOpenHelper` for CRUD operations.

## ⚙️ Features
- Display product list in a **RecyclerView**.  
- Store and retrieve products from a **local SQLite database**.  
- Click on a product to open a **Product Detail Activity**.
